## MATe: Multiagent Architecture for Taming e-Devices

In this paper, we propose MATe, a scalable architecture for discovering and for updating the location for a group of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Negotiation and autonomy are capabilities explored by the proposed architecture. In that, a multiagent layer was built above the device layer to deal with scalability while maintaining the efficiency of current alternatives that use a combination of a widely recognized method, called data aggregation, and a widely adopted distributed structure, called Distributed Hash Table (DHT). In such a layer, each agent has a goal to improve the global scalability. For this, we added capabilities to an agent for negotiating mergings with other agents, for perceiving if it is necessary to create new agents, and for monitoring the behavior of devices it is responsible.
